# PythonSimulations
These are a couple of simulations that I originally made in MIT Scratch to explore physics topics taught in class. Since Scratch 3.0 was released during the creation of my sound wave generator, a lot of the features included in my projectile motion simulator were no longer possible. I decided instead to recreate them in Python using the PyGame library. 
This project helped me strenghten my skills in Python and gain a better understanding of the physics topics I simulated.
